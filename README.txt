ABOUT THIS GAME

LIMITLESS is an arena game that will be 
completely customizable.  It is a homage to 
the old school late 80's-90's RPG games, 
specifically the turn based battle.  This 
game will be completely customizable.  Some
of the features will include the ability to
"level up" your chosen character, the NPC 
players to "level up", and an option for the
game world to develop while not in game play.

This is very early development, not playable 
at this time.

This game was inspired by the author's kids 
and their love for arena/simulation games and
the author's enjoyment of late 80's-90's RPG 
games.

DEVELOPMENT NOTES

[CURRENT UPDATE]

ALPHA 0.0.046 / 2021.03.02-1359

- complete rewrite of the game in vb.net for long term compatiblity and portablity
- migrated from accdb to sqlite for performance and portablity
- ported over legacy java code into placeholders for vb.net version (not available for public)
- created placeholder code to start the migration
- updated readme to reflect new changes
- created new github (https://github.com/AznBlusuazn/Limitless) and archived the former github

[PREVIOUS UPDATES]

[ALL PRIOR UPDATES ARE FROM THE DISCONTINUED JAVA VERSION]
ALPHA 0.0.045 / 2021.02.07-2225

- added "life force" stat for toons - this defines if there is an item that if removed can kill/control the toon (e.g. heart, soul, or enchanted item)
- added race life force and toon specific life force
- modified method of generating unique id numbers for generics to keep a pool of used numbers
- the maximum randomized number is based on the number of toons in the database
- the used unique ids are saved in the game save data
- added "create a new character" button in new game for future use (currently disabled)
- fixed issue with loading saved games without generics and alts included
- fixed rare issue with option settings crashing game
- added loading notice and loading screen when loading saved games
- corrected typo in current area text for world info
- added "game option" buttons 1-5 for future in game options (navigation) when not in battle
- added game world text box, enter, and clear buttons for player navigation

ALPHA 0.0.044 / 2021.02.06-1734

- modified the 3d grid to be separated into areas and sections -- "ground" level will be accessible in all areas.  each area can define if space, air, underground, and hell exists for that area.  each area can be scaled by an infinite number with a minimum of 3 units in x.y.z directions as long as the number is odd (this will always guarantee a "center stage" section for each area).
- each section can have its own "environment" effects that can automatically apply status effects to the characters on the field -- e.g. heat, ice, rain, water, etc. can be applied
- for now, the game will only have one arena but over time this frame will allow a "limitless" amount of possiblities.
- created database tables for areas, sections, and environments
- redesigned area tables and created the Areas method to build areas to scale based on the area
- added ceiling value (is there a ceiling) and merged "air" as part of the "ground" level
- added total units per section value
- added total available area count to world text at world start

ALPHA 0.0.043 / 2021.01.30-1721

- created and developed new table in db for a 3d grid for battles -- the grid will be in x (west to east), y (north to south), z (space to ground to hell) coordinates; foundation is designed to be able to scale (up or down, with or without boundaries) any setting or arena for the battles; melee, ranged, magic attacks along with the ability to escape battle will all be determined by the location of those on the field
- added version number in the lower right corner of menu screen - if clicked, the latest version notes are shown (will try local readme first, then web pull)
- added vertical scrollbar as needed when showing version notes

ALPHA 0.0.042 / 2021.01.30-0001

- added save game corruption detection and prompt to delete corrupted save
- added check for game save database version compatiblity
- removed separate time table for game time and put it into the game save table (formerly "lastused")
- fixed issue with game time calculating an extra year, month, week, and day when converting raw time to game time
- added save state update to start game method (updates save on demand)
- added temporary code to simulate time passing for new games and load games (testing time conversion)

ALPHA 0.0.041 / 2021.01.29-1125

- removed all db queries except initial load -- all game queries are from memory now
- removed settings.ini external file and integrated settings into the save file
- added check for default db check and auto upgrade if not up to date
- added check if default db was copied from another pc -- regenerates new settings for new pc
- greatly decreased lag between menu selection
- gutted old save structure for new .save files for saves
- created foundation for custom dbs in the foundation as .limit files in custom folder
- retired .lastused files for new files in the .save that will contain the information
- added feature that if no additional databases exist, samedb will default
- reorganized memory bank and revamped some of the methods for calling the database
- fixed load saved game to display selected toon and stats correctly
- fixed load saved game button update when no saved games are available
- cleaned up old null/empty commands with cleaner method

ALPHA 0.0.040 / 2021.01.27-1900

- optimized the load time more by shifting lookups to memory instead of the database
- removed methods for all temp files that were previously used for placeholders

ALPHA 0.0.039 / 2021.01.26-1955

- revamped how the game generates new games -- improved initial load time by almost 60%
- added method to decode charsets for transfers between memory, files, and the database
- streamlined the assignment of toonids to generated generics and alternative aliases
- fixed rare issue with special characters not allowing certain times of records to form in the database tables

ALPHA 0.0.038 / 2021.01.25-2350

ALPHA 0.0.037 / 2021.01.24-2313

- revamped the alias logic that existed in the game and rewrote it completely
- added checks to define alias type for toons with aliases (the 4 types defined in ALPHA 0.0.035)
- if toon has a secret alias then the alias toon will be added as a passive character to the game
- if the toon has a known alias that does not have a transformation or different set of stats, the alias and alias image can be toggled in character select
- if the toon has a known alias that does have a transformation or different set of stats, the alternative alias will be a separate passive toon that is linked to the original
- the player will be able to toggle between active/passive (main and alias) during game play whether or not the identity is known (this should simulate playing as bruce banner or the hulk with separate stats)
- for hidden identities, the alternative toon (alias) can be toggled for use by the player as well, but the player will need to be careful not to reveal their identity (unless they want to).  (this should simulate playing as bruce wayne or batman with the same stats but different attires/mask on).
- added logic to build alt toons and link the back to the originals
- added passive switch for toons so they cannot be selected by the user
- fixed a potential issue with the generic generations -- there was a rare issue where no generics were being generated at times; now there will always be at least one generic available at start of the world
- fixed a rare issue with the game crashing if a new game was created after cancelling out of a new game that was created but not started.
- added an "ALT" button to appear on character select if the selected character has a KNOWN alias (secret aliases will not have this option).
- added test avatars for "geoff clark" (man of iron passive alt), "adrian dodgers" (the captain passive alt), "sean cadillac" (mr. dream secret passive alt)

- aliases can now be assigned as either "just name" (captain america and steve rogers), "name with alternative job - known identity" (iron man and tony stark), "secret identity with name and fake stats for job" (e.g. superman and clark kent), or "secret identity with alternative look/job with stat change" (e.g. hulk and bruce banner)
- added "civilian" generic class for "jobs" (see below)
