ABOUT THIS GAME

LIMITLESS is an arena game that will be 
completely customizable.  It is a homage to 
the old school late 80's-90's RPG games, 
specifically the turn based battle.  This 
game will be completely customizable.  Some
of the features will include the ability to
"level up" your chosen character, the NPC 
players to "level up", and an option for the
game world to develop while not in game play.

This is very early development, not playable 
at this time.

This game was inspired by the author's kids 
and their love for arena/simulation games and
the author's enjoyment of late 80's-90's RPG 
games.

[ALL PRIOR UPDATES ARE FROM THE DISCONTINUED JAVA VERSION]
ALPHA 0.0.045 / 2021.02.07-2225

- added "life force" stat for toons - this defines if there is an item that if removed can kill/control the toon (e.g. heart, soul, or enchanted item)
- added race life force and toon specific life force

ALPHA 0.0.044 / 2021.02.06-1734

- modified the 3d grid to be separated into areas and sections -- "ground" level will be accessible in all areas.  each area can define if space, air, underground, and hell exists for that area.  each area can be scaled by an infinite number with a minimum of 3 units in x.y.z directions as long as the number is odd (this will always guarantee a "center stage" section for each area).
- each section can have its own "environment" effects that can automatically apply status effects to the characters on the field -- e.g. heat, ice, rain, water, etc. can be applied
- for now, the game will only have one arena but over time this frame will allow a "limitless" amount of possiblities.
- created database tables for areas, sections, and environments
- redesigned area tables and created the Areas method to build areas to scale based on the area
- added ceiling value (is there a ceiling) and merged "air" as part of the "ground" level
- added total units per section value
- added total available area count to world text at world start

ALPHA 0.0.043 / 2021.01.30-1721

- created and developed new table in db for a 3d grid for battles -- the grid will be in x (west to east), y (north to south), z (space to ground to hell) coordinates; foundation is designed to be able to scale (up or down, with or without boundaries) any setting or arena for the battles; melee, ranged, magic attacks along with the ability to escape battle will all be determined by the location of those on the field
- added version number in the lower right corner of menu screen - if clicked, the latest version notes are shown (will try local readme first, then web pull)
- added vertical scrollbar as needed when showing version notes

ALPHA 0.0.042 / 2021.01.30-0001

- added save game corruption detection and prompt to delete corrupted save
- added check for game save database version compatiblity
- removed separate time table for game time and put it into the game save table (formerly "lastused")
- fixed issue with game time calculating an extra year, month, week, and day when converting raw time to game time
- added save state update to start game method (updates save on demand)
- added temporary code to simulate time passing for new games and load games (testing time conversion)

- revamped the alias logic that existed in the game and rewrote it completely
- added checks to define alias type for toons with aliases (the 4 types defined in ALPHA 0.0.035)
- if toon has a secret alias then the alias toon will be added as a passive character to the game
- if the toon has a known alias that does not have a transformation or different set of stats, the alias and alias image can be toggled in character select
- if the toon has a known alias that does have a transformation or different set of stats, the alternative alias will be a separate passive toon that is linked to the original
- the player will be able to toggle between active/passive (main and alias) during game play whether or not the identity is known (this should simulate playing as bruce banner or the hulk with separate stats)
- for hidden identities, the alternative toon (alias) can be toggled for use by the player as well, but the player will need to be careful not to reveal their identity (unless they want to).  (this should simulate playing as bruce wayne or batman with the same stats but different attires/mask on).
- added logic to build alt toons and link the back to the originals
- added passive switch for toons so they cannot be selected by the user
- fixed a potential issue with the generic generations -- there was a rare issue where no generics were being generated at times; now there will always be at least one generic available at start of the world
- fixed a rare issue with the game crashing if a new game was created after cancelling out of a new game that was created but not started.
- added an "ALT" button to appear on character select if the selected character has a KNOWN alias (secret aliases will not have this option).
